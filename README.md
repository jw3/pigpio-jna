[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/pigpio-jna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/pigpio-jna)

Attempt at a Travis based auto-generation of JNA bindings for the great pigpio library.

Using a git submodule to import pigpio and a dockerized JNAerator we generate a JNA bindings jar and push it to Bintray.
